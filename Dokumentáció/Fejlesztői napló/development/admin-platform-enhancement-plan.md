# Admin Platform Enhancement Plan for Shopping List Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the analysis of the current admin platform (`Forr치sk칩d/Asztali`) and its backend API (`Forr치sk칩d/Backend`) capabilities, compares them against the desired features for a comprehensive admin tool, and proposes a prioritized development plan to bridge the identified gaps.

## 2. Defined Requirements for the Admin Platform

A fully functional admin platform should provide the following capabilities:

**A. User Management:**
    1.  **View Users:** Display a searchable, sortable, paginated list of all registered users.
    2.  **View User Details:** Access detailed profiles for individual users (e.g., registration date, list count, activity logs).
    3.  **Create User:** Manually create new user accounts (optional).
    4.  **Edit User:** Modify user profile information.
    5.  **Manage Roles/Permissions:** Assign/revoke admin privileges, potentially finer-grained roles.
    6.  **Ban/Unban User:** Temporarily or permanently disable user accounts.
    7.  **Delete User:** Permanently remove user accounts.

**B. List Management:**
    1.  **View All Lists:** Display a searchable, sortable, paginated list of *all* shopping lists.
    2.  **Inspect List Content:** View items, collaborators, and history of any list.
    3.  **Modify List Metadata:** Edit list names or other properties (e.g., change ownership).
    4.  **Delete List:** Permanently remove any shopping list.

**C. Item Management:**
    1.  **Manage Global Item Catalog:** Full CRUD operations for the central product catalog.
    2.  **Manage List-Specific Items:** View, edit, or delete items *within any specific user's list*.

**D. Analytics & Reporting:**
    1.  **Dashboard:** Central dashboard with key metrics (user activity, list creation, popular items).
    2.  **Detailed Reports:** Generate reports on user activity, list usage, item popularity.
    3.  **Data Visualization:** Use charts and graphs for trends.

**E. System Configuration:**
    1.  **Manage Settings:** UI to modify backend application settings.
    2.  **Manage Feature Flags:** Enable/disable specific application features dynamically.

**F. Content Moderation:**
    1.  **Review Queue:** (If applicable) Queue for reviewing potentially problematic content.
    2.  **Approve/Reject Content:** Actions to approve or reject flagged content.
