- [x] Document mocking strategy and available mocks
- [ ] Create API testing reference documentation
- [x] Document test data generation approach
- [ ] Maintain living documentation of test coverage

## Maintenance & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Implement weekly review of flaky tests
- [ ] Set up monitoring for test execution time trends
- [ ] Create process for test refactoring when needed
- [ ] Establish review criteria for test quality
- [ ] Implement test for tests (meta-testing)
- [ ] Create standard for test readability and maintainability
- [ ] Establish process for pruning outdated tests

## Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Schedule monthly review of testing strategy
- [ ] Identify gaps in testing coverage
- [ ] Implement monitoring for untested code paths
- [ ] Regularly assess test value vs. maintenance cost
- [ ] Collect and analyze test failure patterns
- [ ] Update testing approach based on new technologies
- [ ] Challenge existing tests for relevance and effectiveness

## Challenges & Questions

For each section above, answer these questions before marking as complete:

1. Have we tested the unhappy paths as thoroughly as the happy paths?
2. Are our mocks accurately representing the behavior of real dependencies?
3. Does this test add value, or is it testing implementation details?
4. How will this test respond to refactoring? Is it too brittle?
5. Is this test maintainable and clear to other developers?
6. Are we testing the right things at the right level of the pyramid?
7. Does this test run fast enough to provide quick feedback?
8. How will this test scale as the codebase grows?
