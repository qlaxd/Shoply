# Backend Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction & Goals

### Purpose
This test plan establishes a comprehensive strategy for testing the backend application to ensure reliability, performance, and security.

### Objectives
- Detect bugs early in the development lifecycle
- Prevent regression issues during development
- Ensure API endpoints function correctly and return expected responses
- Verify business logic and data integrity
- Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Maintain code quality and architecture integrity

### Target Metrics
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage for unit tests
- 95%+ coverage for critical paths and authentication flows
- Maximum response time of 200ms for common API operations under normal load
- Zero security vulnerabilities in released code

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- All REST API endpoints
- Database interactions and query optimizations
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Business logic in service layers
- Background tasks and scheduled jobs
- Error handling and logging mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization

### Out of Scope
- Frontend component testing
- Third-party service reliability (will be mocked)
- UI/UX testing
- Load testing beyond specified performance benchmarks
- Penetration testing (separate security assessment plan)

## 3. Test Strategy

The testing approach follows the testing pyramid model to balance thoroughness with execution speed:

- **Unit Tests (60%)**: Focus on isolated function testing with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests (30%)**: Test interactions between components, API routes, and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Validate complete workflows through the system

This distribution provides rapid feedback through fast-running unit tests while ensuring system components work correctly together through integration and E2E tests.

## 4. Test Types & Techniques

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Focus on service layer business logic
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Employ extensive mocking of external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing with expected status codes and response formats
- Database interaction verification with test database
- Service-to-service interaction testing
- Authentication middleware validation

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user flows (registration, authentication, resource manipulation)
- Multi-step processes involving several API calls
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### Security Tests
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization rules enforcement
- Common vulnerability checks (injection, XSS, CSRF)

### Performance Tests
- Response time monitoring for critical endpoints
- Database query execution time
- Resource utilization under expected load

### Techniques
- Mocking external APIs and services
- Stubbing database responses for unit tests
- Dependency injection for component isolation
- Test doubles for third-party services
- Database transaction rollbacks for test isolation

## 5. Tools & Frameworks

### Testing Libraries
- **Jest**: Primary test runner and assertion library
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions for API testing
- **Sinon**: Mocks, stubs, and spies
- **MongoDB Memory Server**: In-memory MongoDB for tests
- **Faker.js**: Test data generation

### Utility Tools
- **Istanbul/nyc**: Code coverage reporting
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit tests
- **Nock**: HTTP request mocking
- **node-mocks-http**: Express request/response mocking

## 6. Test Environment Setup

### Local Development
- Isolated test database (MongoDB Memory Server)
- Environment variables configuration via `.env.test`
- Mocked external services and APIs

### CI Environment
- Dedicated test database instance
- Containerized test execution (Docker)
- Ephemeral infrastructure for each test run
- Parallelized test execution where possible

### Configuration
```javascript
// Jest configuration example
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/', '/dist/'],
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov'],
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage'
};
```

## 7. Test Data Management

### Strategies
- Use in-memory database for unit/integration tests
- Generate dynamic test data using Faker.js
- Maintain fixed seed data for predictable tests
- Use database transactions to rollback after tests
- Implement database cleanup hooks after test suites

### Data Isolation
- Each test creates its own data
- Use unique identifiers for test resources
- Reset database state between test suites
- Avoid dependencies between test cases

## 8. Test Case Design & Organization

### Directory Structure
```
__tests__/
  ├── unit/
  │   ├── services/
  │   ├── utils/
  │   └── models/
  ├── integration/
  │   ├── routes/
  │   ├── middleware/
  │   └── database/
  ├── e2e/
  │   └── flows/
  ├── fixtures/
  ├── helpers/
  └── setup/
```

### Naming Conventions
- `[component].[method].[scenario].test.js`
- Example: `user.create.validInput.test.js`

### Test Structure
- Use descriptive test cases with the AAA pattern:
  - Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
  - Act: Execute the code being tested
  - Assert: Verify expected outcomes

```javascript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create a user with valid input', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userData = { /* valid user data */ };
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toHaveProperty('id');
      expect(result.email).toBe(userData.email);
    });
  });
});
```

## 9. Execution & Reporting

### Execution Strategy
- Run unit tests on every code change
- Run integration tests before commits
- Run E2E tests during CI/CD pipeline
- Execute full test suite before deployment

### Reporting
- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Integrate test results with CI/CD dashboards
- Send notifications for test failures
- Track metrics over time (coverage trends, test duration)

### Continuous Monitoring
- Track flaky tests and fix regularly
- Monitor test execution time trends
- Analyze coverage gaps and address them

## 10. CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Configuration
- Execute unit and integration tests on pull requests
- Run full test suite, including E2E, before merging to main branch
- Gate deployments based on test results
- Cache dependencies to speed up test execution

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Backend Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test:unit
      - run: npm run test:integration
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```
