# Backend Testing Implementation Checklist

This document tracks the implementation progress of our testing strategy. Mark items as completed only when they fully satisfy the criteria - no partial credit.

## Foundation Setup

- [ ] Install and configure Jest as the primary test runner

- [ ] Test authorization checks on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Implement authentication bypass attempt tests
- [ ] Test for insecure direct object references
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection where needed
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Check for security headers on all responses
- [ ] Verify password policies and storage security
- [ ] Test API keys/token management security

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Set up response time baseline measurements
- [ ] Implement performance tests for critical endpoints
- [ ] Test database query performance
- [ ] Measure and optimize N+1 query issues
- [ ] Test caching mechanisms effectiveness
- [ ] Verify resource utilization under expected load
- [ ] Create performance regression tests

## CI/CD Integration

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Configure test parallelization in CI
- [ ] Implement caching of dependencies in CI
- [ ] Set up test result reporting in CI
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting in CI
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules requiring passing tests
- [ ] Implement deployment gates based on test results
- [ ] Create notification system for test failures

## Documentation

- [ ] Document test approach for new team members
- [ ] Create how-to guides for writing new tests
- [ ] Document mocking strategy and available mocks
- [ ] Create API testing reference documentation
- [ ] Document test data generation approach
- [ ] Maintain living documentation of test coverage

## Maintenance & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Implement weekly review of flaky tests
- [ ] Set up monitoring for test execution time trends
- [ ] Create process for test refactoring when needed
- [ ] Establish review criteria for test quality
- [ ] Implement test for tests (meta-testing)
- [ ] Create standard for test readability and maintainability
- [ ] Establish process for pruning outdated tests

## Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Schedule monthly review of testing strategy
- [ ] Identify gaps in testing coverage
- [ ] Implement monitoring for untested code paths
- [ ] Regularly assess test value vs. maintenance cost
- [ ] Collect and analyze test failure patterns
- [ ] Update testing approach based on new technologies
- [ ] Challenge existing tests for relevance and effectiveness

## Challenges & Questions

For each section above, answer these questions before marking as complete:

1. Have we tested the unhappy paths as thoroughly as the happy paths?
2. Are our mocks accurately representing the behavior of real dependencies?
3. Does this test add value, or is it testing implementation details?
4. How will this test respond to refactoring? Is it too brittle?
5. Is this test maintainable and clear to other developers?
6. Are we testing the right things at the right level of the pyramid?
7. Does this test run fast enough to provide quick feedback?
8. How will this test scale as the codebase grows?
